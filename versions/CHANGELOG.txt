PROCEDURE TASK — VERSION CHANGELOG
====================================

v2-dob-autocollapse
-------------------
- Added Date of Birth field (day/month/year input group) to the Applicant Details page,
  placed between Last Name and National ID number
- Auto-collapse document previews on page navigation: when the participant clicks Continue,
  all open document accordions are closed and the slide-out document drawer is dismissed,
  so the form stays in focus without requiring manual cleanup
- Engine change: added _collapseDocumentPreviews() method called in nextPage() before
  navigating to the next page

v1-initial
----------
- Initial implementation of the Green Zone Vehicle Access Permit procedure
- Full 19-page flow: consent, instructions, applicant details, eligibility assessment,
  document uploads, vehicle details (4 pages), declaration, submission, demographics,
  attention check, feedback, debrief, completion
- Declarative procedure definition system (procedure_greenzone.js) with pluggable engine
- GOV.UK Design System-inspired styling (gov.css)
- Document reference panel: 6 fictional documents in collapsible accordions with slide-out
  drawer viewer (zoom in/out, Ctrl+scroll, fit-to-width)
- Section-based progress stepper (visible only during the main application flow)
- Form validation on submit with error summary and per-field error messages
- Behavioral tracking: per-page timing, document open/close tracking, validation error
  counting, form response collection
- Session persistence and resume on refresh
- Prolific integration (PROLIFIC_PID, STUDY_ID, SESSION_ID URL parameters)
- Server-side JSONL data storage with CSV export and researcher dashboard
- Duplicate participation prevention
